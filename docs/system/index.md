# System Documentation


Welcome to the documentation for AgentECS's systems and interfaces.
In this section you will find detailed information about the core concepts, components, and systems that make up the AgentECS framework.

If you are looking for how to implement specific use cases, please refer to the cookbook section [here](cookbook/index.md).
Before diving into the details, you may want to read the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide to set up your environment and create your first AgentECS application, and the [Design Philosophy](design-philosophy.md) to understand the principles behind AgentECS's architecture.
