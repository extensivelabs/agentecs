      "\n",
      "The bell above the door chimed at 11:47 PM, thirteen minutes before closing. Marcus looked up from wiping down the espresso machine, already calculating how much longer this would take. The customer was a woman in her sixties, wearing a rain-soaked coat that dripped onto the café's worn floorboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you still open?\" she asked, breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus gestured to the chairs already stacked on tables. \"Technically.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just need coffee. Black. Please.\" Something in her voice—a tremor, a desperate edge—made him pause mid-excuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure. Have a seat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She chose the only unstacked table, the wobbly one by the window that Marcus kept meaning to fix. While the machine hissed and gurgled, he watched her in the mirror behind the counter. She sat perfectly still, staring at her hands folded on the table like she was holding something invisible and precious between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus brought the coffee over. Up close, he noticed her eyes were red-rimmed, her silver hair escaping from a bun in wild tendrils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three fifty,\" he said, but she was already holding out a five.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He should have gone back to closing duties. Instead, he found himself asking, \"Rough night?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed—a sound like breaking glass. \"Rough forty years.\" She wrapped both hands around the mug. \"I'm sorry. You don't need to hear this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's okay. I'm not in a rush.\" The lie surprised him. He was always in a rush—to close, to get home, to check his phone, to be anywhere but here in this failing café his father had left him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just came from the hospital,\" she said. \"My husband died three hours ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus's throat tightened. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everyone keeps saying that.\" She took a sip. \"But you know what's strange? I feel... relieved. Is that terrible?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled out the chair across from her and sat down. \"I don't know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had forty-two years together. Forty-two years of him criticizing every meal I cooked, every friend I made, every dream I mentioned out loud. He never hit me. Never screamed. Just this constant, dripping disappointment that made me smaller and smaller until I could barely remember who I was before him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked up at Marcus with fierce, bright eyes. \"And now he's gone, and I'm seventy-three years old, and I walked out of that hospital and realized I have absolutely no idea what to do with freedom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus thought about the café, how he'd been running it for six years since his father's stroke. How he'd put his architecture degree in a drawer and picked up an apron. How every day felt like honoring a debt he'd never agreed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you do?\" he asked quietly. \"If you could do anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face transformed. \"There's a pottery studio three blocks from my house. I walk past it every day. They have classes for beginners.\" She laughed again, lighter this time. \"Isn't that silly? Seventy-three and wanting to play with clay like a child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's not silly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What about you?\" She tilted her head. \"What would you do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer came immediately, from some locked room inside him. \"I'd design buildings. Beautiful ones. Places that make people feel something when they walk inside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So why don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's complicated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It always is.\" She finished her coffee and stood, steadier now. \"Thank you for this. For listening. For staying open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad you came in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door, she turned back. \"That studio has an open house next Tuesday. I'm going to walk in instead of past. You should think about what door you're going to walk through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The bell chimed as she left. Marcus watched her disappear into the rain, shoulders squared, walking with purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked around the empty café—the peeling paint, the ancient espresso machine, the wobbly table. His father had loved this place with an intensity that left no room for anything else, including Marcus's own dreams. But his father was gone. Had been gone, really, even before the stroke took his words and left only those demanding eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus pulled out his phone. His old professor's email was still in his contacts. He started typing: \"Hi Professor Chen. I know it's been six years, but I'm wondering if that offer to review my portfolio still stands...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He hesitated, finger hovering over send.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he thought of the woman, seventy-three and finally free, walking toward a pottery studio in the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pressed send.\n",
      "\n",
      "The café would close eventually—maybe he'd sell it, maybe he'd let it go. But tonight, for the first time in years, Marcus felt like he'd actually opened something.\n",
      "\n",
      "He finished cleaning quickly, turned off the lights, and locked the door at 12:03 AM. As he walked to his car, he noticed the rain had stopped. Above the city's glow, a few stubborn stars pushed through the clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus smiled and headed home, already sketching buildings in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Calculate the tip for a $47.50 restaurant bill\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Recommend a book\n",
      "   ✅ Excellent! Since you've devoured all of Neal Stephenson's work, you clearly appreciate ambitious, intellectually dense science fiction with intricate world-building and deep technical detail. Here are three recommendations that should satisfy that same craving:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Top Recommendation: \"Anathem\" by... wait, you've read that! Let me give you:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**\"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin** (translated by Ken Liu)\n",
      "This Chinese sci-fi masterpiece shares Stephenson's love of hard science, grand scope, and mind-bending concepts. It weaves together the Cultural Revolution, virtual reality, physics, and first contact with an alien civilization in ways that are both intellectually rigorous and narratively gripping. Like Stephenson, Liu doesn't shy away from complex scientific explanations, and the trilogy expands into truly cosmic scales. If you loved the Baroque Cycle's historical depth mixed with *Seveneves'* hard SF, this is your next obsession.\n",
      "\n",
      "**\"Blindsight\" by Peter Watts**\n",
      "A darker, tighter alternative - this is hard SF that explores consciousness, intelligence, and what it means to be human through a first-contact scenario. Watts is a marine biologist, and his scientific rigor rivals Stephenson's, but in a more philosophically unsettling package. Think *Snow Crash* meets *Solaris*.\n",
      "\n",
      "**\"The Peripheral\" by William Gibson**\n",
      "Gibson's recent work has evolved into something remarkably Stephenson-esque - complex time-travel mechanics, near-future technology, intricate plotting, and that same ability to make you feel like you're glimpsing our actual future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which direction appeals most - epic scope, philosophical darkness, or near-future complexity?\n",
