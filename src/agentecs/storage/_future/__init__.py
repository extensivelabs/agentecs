"""Future storage backend implementations.

This package is a placeholder for upcoming storage backends:
- ArchetypalStorage for cache-efficient O(matched) queries - REQ-018
- SparseSetStorage for rare components
- Distributed storage backend for cross-shard queries - REQ-022
- Rust-backed storage via PyO3 - REQ-023

These will be implemented to optimize performance and enable distributed scaling.
